# Real-time Sign Language Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a real-time sign language detection system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system aims to bridge communication barriers for individuals with hearing impairments by accurately recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures in real-time.

## Features
- Hand detection and tracking using OpenCV.
- Gesture recognition using machine learning models trained on sign language datasets.
- Low-latency operation for instant response to sign language gestures.
- User-friendly interface for seamless communication.
- Integration with hardware acceleration libraries for optimized performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.

## Usage
1. Run the main application:
2. Follow on-screen instructions to start real-time sign language detection.
